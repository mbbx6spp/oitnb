## ointb

A set of components that together combine to provide a silly OINTB fan site,
from data import from IMDB in Haskell to web-based games written in Elm to
showcase how functional programming techniques and ideas can be used in
many different and practical ways.

### Status

In development. Just started (Sept 2015).

### Plan

This is a tangible but utterly silly application (set of components) to aid
in blogging about my FP endeavors and learnings to help others learning
some of these FP ideas and commonly used abstractions more material to aid
in their development.

I hope to introduce the following ideas through various components of this
application:

* basic FP abstractions (functors, monoids, etc.)
* intermediate FP abstractions (state, reader, writer, etc. applications of
  the dreaded _"monad"_ plus validations via applicative builders, etc.)
* more advanced FP abstractions (e.g. zippers, lenses)
* how these common FP abstractions relate to each other
* using FRP for front-end games
* using parsing combinators to enable media processing of a kind
* type-level applications

The first component will be the data importer.
